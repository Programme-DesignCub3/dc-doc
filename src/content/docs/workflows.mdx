## Git Workflow

We follow a trunk-based development workflow with feature branches:

### Branch Naming

- Feature branches: `feature/description-of-feature`
- Bug fixes: `fix/description-of-bug`
- Hotfixes: `hotfix/description-of-issue`

### Commit Messages

We follow the Conventional Commits specification:

```bash
feat: add new feature
fix: resolve bug
docs: update documentation
style: format code
refactor: restructure code
test: add tests
chore: update dependencies
```

## CI/CD Pipeline

Our continuous integration and deployment pipeline ensures code quality and reliable deployments:

### Pull Request Checks

1. Linting
2. Type checking
3. Unit tests
4. Integration tests
5. Build verification

### Deployment Stages

1. Development (automatic)
2. Staging (automatic with approval)
3. Production (manual trigger)

## Code Review Process

Guidelines for effective code reviews:

1. Review within 24 hours
2. Focus on:
   - Code quality
   - Test coverage
   - Performance
   - Security
3. Use constructive feedback
4. Verify changes locally

## Release Process

Steps for releasing new versions:

1. Version bump
2. Changelog update
3. Release notes
4. Tag creation
