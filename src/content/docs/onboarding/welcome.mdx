Welcome to our development team! This guide will walk you through everything you need to know
to get started as a developer in our organization. We'll cover setting up your development
environment, understanding our project structure, and following our coding standards.

## Development Environment

Our development environment is designed to be consistent across the team and easy to set up.
Here's what you'll need to install:

- Node.js (LTS version)
- Git
- Visual Studio Code
- Docker Desktop

### Editor Setup

We recommend using Visual Studio Code as your primary code editor. It provides excellent
support for our tech stack and can be configured with team-shared settings.

### Recommended Extensions

- ESLint
- Prettier
- GitLens
- Tailwind CSS IntelliSense

## Project Structure

Our projects follow a consistent structure to make it easy to navigate and maintain:

```
/src
  /components   # Reusable UI components
  /layouts      # Page layouts and templates
  /pages        # Route pages
  /utils        # Utility functions
  /styles       # Global styles
  /types        # TypeScript type definitions
/public         # Static assets
/tests          # Test files
```

## Coding Standards

We follow industry best practices and have established coding standards to maintain
consistency across our codebase:

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow ESLint and Prettier configurations
- Write unit tests for all new features
- Use meaningful commit messages following conventional commits

## Next Steps
